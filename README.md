# Aragon Fundraising

Aragon Fundraising is a suite of **Aragon** apps providing Aragon organizations continuous fundraising capabilities.

It enables users to buy and redeem one organization's token through an automated **market maker** automatically matching orders according to a **bonding curve** tied to the **Bancor** formula. The funds held by this market maker **reserve pool** are controlled by a **tap** and released over time into a **discretionary pool** controlled by the organization's board to sustain the project. This architecture provides smart-contract enforced **accountability** between investors and board members throughout the lifecycle of a project while simultaneously ensuring **sufficient liquidity** to support the emergence of a **long-tail of micro-organizations**.

You can test the Aragon Fundraising app suite - with fake money - at  [https://rinkeby.aragon.org/](https://rinkeby.aragon.org/) or launch a real fundraising campaign at [https://mainnet.aragon.org/](https://mainnet.aragon.org/%20).
