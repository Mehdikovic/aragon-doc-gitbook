# Advanced Trading Settings \(whitelisting, collaterals, fees\)

**White/Black List**

To create a whitelist for buyers and sellers you can go to the Fundraising app's permissions list and click change manager on the "open buy order" or "open sell order" which is by default open to any account:

In the side panel you can then change the manager to a custom address or another app that can hold addresses such as Autark's Address Book.

As the manager of this permission is the Share Voting app this will require a positive vote of shareholders!

A blacklist is simply done by removing universal access and not having specific addresses whitelisted.
