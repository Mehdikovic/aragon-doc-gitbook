In the right box the current share token supply, name and contract address of the Fundraising Token is displayed.

In the centre box the monthly allocation \(tap\) is displayed in DAI per month. 

The monthly allocation is the amount of tokens of collateral that can be withdrawn from the reserves per time period by founders to sustain the underlying project.  In the smart contracts it is defined as "the number of tokens per second which can be withdrawn from the reserve". 

The floor is also displayed in DAI per month. 

The various collateralization ratios corresponding to the different supported collateral tokens are also displayed.

Updating the Monthly Allocation can be made by clicking on Editing  monthly allocation and signing a transaction ,by default a positive vote of shareholders is required to ratify this. 

Before signing the transaction triggering the vote the side panel shows the max % change supported for the monthly allocation and floor.

We will see in the permission settings who can update the monthly allocation and floor.
