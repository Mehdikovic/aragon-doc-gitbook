The next step is to claim a domain for the organization:



This allows access to the DAO \(via the Ethereum Name Service\) where any user can input that URL address in their browser. A green checkmark shows DAO name availability.

The board token name and symbol can be chosen as well as the list of initial board member token holders with 1 token per member. Members can be added \(with a flexible number of issued tokens\) and removed later on by a vote of existing board token holder. To note that this token is non-transferable.

This screen allows for configuring the voting app of board tokenholders:

* Support denotes the percent of expressed votes for a vote to pass. 
* Minimum approval is the minimum % of positive votes in terms of the total supply of tokens for a vote to be considered valid.
* Vote duration is the amount of time a vote remains open.

Next up some info about the organization's shareholder governance.
